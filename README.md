# 2048 AI

This repo contains a Python implementation of the classic game by [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli), with a GUI that uses the PyGame library, and an Artificial Intelligence based on Deep Reinforcement Learning that learns to play the game. The AI implemented here was based on the third lab of MIT's [Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) course, where the artificial agents learn to play Cartpole and Pong.

The game implementation was first made as a small side project, whereas the AI was implemented as the final project for the class of Computer Graphics Seminar in the second semester of 2020 (Marchâ€“May 2021) at UFRGS. The PDF report of the project can be found [here](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~awcampana/docs/2048-AI.pdf), and the presentation with a small demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HZkBgFV9Qo).

To run the files in this project, it is necessary to install the dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. To play the game, run ```python gui.py```. To experiment with the AI, run ```python ai.py```.
